##### So how does it all work?

- Animals roam the map. When they stand on a grass field, it is eaten, and the animal gains energy.
- When two animals meet, and they have enough energy, they breed, producing offspring.
- The less energy the animal has, the whiter it becomes.
- If animal runs out of energy, it dies.
- There are two types of land: jungle and steppe
- Everyday, two grasses are generated, one on each land



##### How to use?

Simulation starts with parameters written to parameters.json. You can stop it by pressing STOP button. Then you can start it again. When simulation is paused you can:
- press animal to show some data about it
- save current data to .txt file using SAVE button
- show animals with dominating genotype (they will illumiante yellow)
- pin animal by pressing it and show data about it (you will be able to type its name)
